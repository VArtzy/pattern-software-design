# Software Design Pattern Concept, Implementation and Exercise

There are **23 design patterns** in total (23 classic Design Patterns, although at least 26 Design Patterns have been discovered to date), categorized into three groups:

1. **[Practical Creational Patterns](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/creational)**: 5 patterns  
2. **[Practical Structural Patterns](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/structural)**: 7 patterns  
3. **[Practical Behavioral Patterns](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/behavioral)**: 11 patterns

### **Creational Patterns**  
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.  
- **[Factory Method](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/factory)**  
- **[Abstract Factory](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/abstract-factory)**  
- **[Builder](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/builder)**  
- **[Prototype](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/prototype)**  
- **[Singleton](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/singleton)**

### **Structural Patterns**  
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.  
- **[Adapter](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/adapter)**  
- **[Bridge](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/bridge)**  
- **[Composite](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/composite)**  
- **[Decorator](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/decorator)**  
- **[Facade](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/facade)**  
- **[Flyweight](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/flyweight)**  
- **[Proxy](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/proxy)**

### **Behavioral Patterns**  
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.  
- **[Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/chain-of-responsibility)**  
- **[Command](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/command)**  
- **[Iterator](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/iterator)**  
- **[Mediator](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/mediator)**  
- **[Memento](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/memento)**  
- **[Observer](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/observer)**  (Fun fact: PubSub pattern is distributed -- asynchronous and many-to-many version of observer)
- **[State](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/state)**  
- **[Strategy](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/strategy)**  
- **[Template Method](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/template-method)**  
- **[Visitor](https://github.com/VArtzy/pattern-software-design/tree/main/visitor)**
